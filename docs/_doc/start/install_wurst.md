### Install Compiler

The setup will check if the compiler has already been installed. If not, you are required to install it
before you can create a project.

To install the compiler simply click the **Install Wurst** button.

### Create Project

Now that the compiler is installed you can go ahead and create your Wurst project.
Select your desired project folder and name and start the process by clicking the **Create Project** button.
The setup will now create a wurst project structure and download the neccessary dependencies.

When the setup has finished, you can now open the project's root folder in VSCode.
Open the Hello.wurst file to activate the Wurst plugin. The code should compile and the setup should be done.
