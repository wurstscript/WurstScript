### *&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-exclamation-circle} This guide expects the reader to know map development with Jass.
------

## Welcome

This guide will explain how to use regular Jass (including GUI) and vJass resources next to Wurst.
This guide will **not** explain how to convert (v)Jass to Wurst.

## Motivation

There are many different cases in which users might want to use legacy resources in Wurst projects, for example:
- Using existing (v)Jass resources without converting them to Wurst
- Using Wurst on an existing legacy map without hassle nor losing existing code
- Making adjustments to maps to which the source does not exist
- Maintaining legacy maps with Jurst instead of performing a complete re-write

{: .answer}
### *&nbsp;*{: .fa .fa-exclamation-circle} However, it is strongly advised to only do this for legacy maps. New projects should be developed in Wurst only.
