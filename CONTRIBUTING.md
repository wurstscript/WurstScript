# Contributing

Found a code issue to fix, improvement to make or feature to add?
Great! We gladly welcome all contributions to any of the Wurst products!

However it is highly recommended to **contact us prior to starting your contribution** 
to prevent any issues from coming up later due to missing communication beforehand.
Pull Requests are amazing, but if they don't meet our expectations and conventions, 
it might take a long time until they get merged, if at all.

Thus it should be your goal to make as small and encapsulated PRs as possible, mainly focusing on one specific issue or feature.
The smaller the PR, the faster it can be reviewed and finally merged.

Feel free to use our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstScript/issues) or drop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mSHZpWcadz).
